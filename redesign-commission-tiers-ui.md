## 📋 Summary of Work

We have successfully redesigned and enhanced the Commission System admin interface, spanning Tiers, Transactions, and User settings. The goal was to transform a functional but basic interface into a premium, modern dashboard that provides a "WOW" experience for administrators.

### Key Enhancements

#### 1. Commission Tiers Page (`/admin/commission/tiers`)
- **Bento Grid Layout**: Implemented a dynamic grid where each tier is a beautiful "bento card".
- **Glassmorphism**: Used `backdrop-blur-md` and `bg-white/80` for a high-end feel.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Improved typography and spacing. Tier rates and requirements are now clearly structured.
- **Interactive States**: Added smooth scale transitions and vibrant shadow effects on hover.
- **Iconography**: Standardized all icons using `lucide-react`, removing emojis.

#### 2. Commission Transactions Page (`/admin/commission/transactions`)
- **Stats Dashboard**: Added real-time summary cards (Pending, Approved, Paid, Cancelled) with gradients and shadow depth.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Redesigned the filter bar into a clean, integrated component with better UX.
- **Bulk Action Bar**: Implemented a floating "Action Bar" that appears when transactions are selected, providing quick access to Approve/Pay/Reject buttons.
- **Table Polish**: Softened table headers, added user avatars (placeholders), and improved status badge styling.

#### 3. Commission Users Page (`/admin/commission/users`)
- **Affiliate Management**: Modernized the user table with clear roles and tier badges.
- **Smart Filters**: Integrated search and filter dropdowns into a cohesive bento card.
- **Action Buttons**: Replaced text buttons with sleek, icon-based action buttons for a cleaner view.
- **Admin Modal**: Refined the settings modal with better layout and clear sections for stats and settings.

### 🎨 Design System Applied
- **Typography**: Optimized font weights for readability and hierarchy.
- **Palette**: Violet, Emerald, Amber, and Slate colors used for semantic meaning.
- **Effects**: Backdrop blur, subtle borders, and layered shadows.

## ✅ Verification
- [x] Tiers displayed in Bento-style grid.
- [x] Hover states responsive and alive.
